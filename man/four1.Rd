Numbers of your cards and the board cards.

\details{
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
}
\value{
15*number of the foursome + the number of your next highest other card.
For instance, if your best 5 card hand is 8888K, then it will return 15*8 
+ 13 = 133.
Returns 0 if you don't have 4 of a kind.
